# Memory Card Game

## Description

    The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.      Each turn:
      A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
      The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
      If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
      If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
      The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
